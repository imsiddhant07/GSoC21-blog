# Documenting my GSoC'21 journey at [DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/)



## 17/05/2021
Never been this excited, the results for GSoC'21 were announced today. I'll be working with **DBpedia** this summer on the Project **Neural QA Model for DBpedia** mentored by Tommaso Soru and Anand Panchbhai.
17/05/2021-06/06/2021 will be our Community bonding period and for me a little time to brush up my ideas.

Had my first meet (virtual ofcourse) with Mentors, one of the mentors could not join due to some health issues. They are really very friendly and helpful. Overall meeting:

-> Firstly a nice and long introduction

-> Discussed the longterm vision 

-> Not much discussion on workflow as the timeline on my proposal was ok.
