## Documenting my GSoC'21 journey at [DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/)




##17/05/2021 WEEK 0
Never been this excited, the results for GSoC'21 were announced today. I'll be working with **DBpedia** this summer on the Project **Neural QA Model for DBpedia** mentored by Tommaso Soru and Anand Panchbhai.
17/05/2021-06/06/2021 will be our Community bonding period and for me a little time to brush up my ideas.


##19/05/2021 
Had my first meet (virtual ofcourse) with Mentors, one of the mentors could not join due to some health issues. They are really very friendly and helpful. Some of the meeting highlights:
-> Firstly a nice and long introduction
-> Discussed the longterm vision 
-> Not much discussion on workflow as the timeline on my proposal was ok.


##Next up we have Community meeting planned on 3rd June '21.


Will keep this updated as I go along, thank you :)
