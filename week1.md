##  Week 1 | 07/06/2021 - 13/06/2021 

### Project overview

My project **"Neural QA Model for DBpedia"** has an end term goal of helping normal users (non-dev) explore the huge knowledge graphs at DBpedia by putting in questions in thier native laguage (English as of now). Ahh, but is answering a question such a big deal for a project? Kindoff yes.

Accessing these huge knowledge graph is only possible using querys - specificlly SPARQL queries, now for a normal person writing a SPARQL query is too much to expect. Thus we come bridging the gap - Translating your Native language question to SPARQL query. Yes, a slightly inlined towards machine translation project.

Also this is the 4th year for the project to be selected in Google Summer of Code, the project has evolved very well over the period of time. Taking it further we intend to bring it few steps closer to perfect ;) That being said, I'll be using two major datasets DBNQA and Lc-QuAD both as training and testing respectively.

### Timeline 

For the first 3 weeks (07/06/2021 - 27/06/2021) I shall be implementing "Syntax Aware Augmentation" as a resort of making the model robust to noise and extending the current state of dataset.
